refactor(commands): simplify /continue and /review - think, don't checklist

- Remove prescriptive checklists that cause mechanical execution
- Add thought-provoking questions instead of items to check
- /review accepts any semantic input, not just domain names
- Trust LLM intelligence to understand and apply judgment
