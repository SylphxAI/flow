# Sylphx Flow

> One CLI to rule them all — unified orchestration for Claude Code, OpenCode, and all AI development tools

---

## Vision

**The Meta-Layer for AI Development Tools**

Sylphx Flow is the universal orchestrator that eliminates the fragmentation of AI coding assistants. Instead of choosing between Claude Code, OpenCode, Cursor, or future tools — install once, use everywhere. Flow auto-detects, auto-installs, auto-upgrades, and adapts to any environment.

**Core Philosophy**: AI should adapt to developers, not the other way around.

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Current |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **npm Downloads** | 10K+ monthly | [Track on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sylphx/flow) |
| **GitHub Stars** | 1K+ | [Track on GitHub](https://github.com/SylphxAI/flow) |
| **Prompt Efficiency** | 50x shorter (10 words vs 500) | ✅ Achieved via MEP |
| **Developer Time Saved** | 30x faster context setup | ✅ Achieved |
| **Platform Coverage** | 3+ AI CLIs supported | Claude Code, OpenCode, Cursor |

---

## Target Users

### Primary: Professional Developers
- **Pain Point**: Fragmented tooling across Claude Code, OpenCode, Cursor
- **Pain Point**: Manual installation and updates of AI CLIs
- **Pain Point**: Verbose prompts required for context (500+ words)
- **Pain Point**: Accidental git commits of AI tool configs

### Secondary: Development Teams
- **Pain Point**: Inconsistent AI tool configurations across team members
- **Pain Point**: No centralized settings management
- **Pain Point**: Each developer maintains separate tool setups

## Value Propositions

| Value | How Flow Delivers |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Unification** | One CLI orchestrates all AI coding tools |
| **Zero Friction** | Auto-detect, auto-install, auto-upgrade |
| **MEP (Minimal Effective Prompt)** | 3-10 words instead of 500+ |
| **Git Safety** | Skip-worktree protection hides temp configs |
| **Graceful Interruption** | Ctrl+C restores environment cleanly |
| **Specialized Agents** | Coder, Writer, Reviewer, Orchestrator |

## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Strengths | Weaknesses | Flow's Differentiation |
|------------|-----------|------------|------------------------|
| **Claude Code** | Best-in-class AI, official Anthropic | Single-platform lock-in | Flow orchestrates it |
| **OpenCode** | Open source, community-driven | Less polished | Flow orchestrates it |
| **Cursor** | IDE integration, visual | Heavy, IDE-only | Flow is CLI-first, lightweight |
| **Cline/Continue** | VSCode extensions | IDE-specific | Flow is universal |

**Flow's Moat**: We don't compete with AI CLIs — we orchestrate them. One CLI, all tools.

## Roadmap

### Now (Current Focus)
- Maintain platform parity (Claude Code, OpenCode)
- Bug fixes and stability
- Documentation improvements

### Next (Q1 2025)
- Loop mode for OpenCode
- Team settings sync
- IDE plugin (VSCode)
- GitHub Actions integration

### Later (2025+)
- Cloud execution (remote AI orchestration)
- Custom agent framework
- Enterprise features (SSO, audit logs)
- Additional AI CLI integrations as they emerge
