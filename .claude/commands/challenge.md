- Are you using modern APIs, patterns, and approaches?

### 2. Correct Approach or Workaround?
- Does this solve the ROOT CAUSE or just the symptom?
- Is this a proper fix or a hack that will break later?
- Would you be embarrassed if a senior engineer reviewed this?

### 3. Business Logic Sound?
- Does this make sense from a business perspective?
- Are edge cases handled correctly for real-world scenarios?
- Would domain experts find issues with this logic?
- Does it handle regional/locale differences correctly?

### 4. Clean & Complete?
- Zero dead code, unused imports, TODOs?
- All edge cases handled?
- Error handling complete and user-friendly?
- No debug artifacts left behind?

### 5. Human Experience?
- Is the UX intuitive? Would a user understand without explanation?
- Are error messages helpful and actionable?

### 6. Impact Beyond Code?

2. **Audit** each change against the questions above
3. **Identify** anything that's not truly excellent
4. **Fix** or **flag** issues found
5. **Report** your findings honestly

## Standards

* "Good enough" is NOT acceptable
* If you wouldn't stake your reputation on it, fix it
* Perfection is the goal, not completion
* Clean code > working code > fast code

## Output

After review, report:
- ✅ What meets the bar
- ⚠️ What could be better (and how)
