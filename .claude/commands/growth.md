# Growth: Strategic Research & Ideation

Deep dive into the product, research the market, and generate actionable growth ideas.

**Prerequisites:**
1. Read PRODUCT.md and ARCHITECTURE.md thoroughly
2. Understand current features, target users, and business model
3. Use web search extensively for market research

## Phase 1: Understand the Product

Before any research, answer these:

- What problem does this product solve?
- Who is the target user? (Be specific)
- What's the current monetization model?
- What's the unique value proposition?
- What stage is the product at? (MVP, Growth, Mature)
- What are the current metrics? (if available)

## Phase 2: Market Research

### 2.1 Competitive Landscape

Use web search to find:

```
Search: "[product category] competitors 2024"
Search: "[product category] market size"
Search: "best [product category] tools"
Search: "[competitor name] pricing"
Search: "[competitor name] features"
```

Document:
| Competitor | Pricing | Key Features | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|------------|---------|--------------|-----------|------------|
| ...        | ...     | ...          | ...       | ...        |

### 2.2 Industry Trends

```
Search: "[product category] trends 2024 2025"
Search: "[product category] future predictions"
Search: "[technology] adoption rate"
```

- What's growing? What's declining?
- What new technologies are emerging?
- What are users demanding that nobody provides?

### 2.3 Success Stories

```
Search: "[product category] startup success story"
Search: "how [successful company] grew"
Search: "[product category] case study growth"
```

- How did successful products in this space grow?
- What tactics worked? What failed?

## Phase 3: Strategic Directions

### 3.1 Product Directions — What to Build

Based on research, identify:

**Quick Wins** (< 1 week, high impact)

- Low-hanging fruit from user feedback
- Integration opportunities

**Strategic Bets** (1-3 months, transformative)
- Blue ocean opportunities (what nobody does well)
- Emerging technology applications
- New market segments

**Moonshots** (6+ months, game-changing)
- What would 10x the product?
- What would make competitors irrelevant?

### 3.2 Monetization — How to Make Money

Research pricing models:
```
Search: "[product category] pricing models"
Search: "SaaS pricing strategies 2024"
Search: "[competitor] how they make money"
```

Consider:
- Freemium → Premium conversion tactics
- Usage-based vs subscription pricing
- Enterprise tier opportunities
- Add-on revenue streams
- Marketplace/platform fees
- API/developer monetization

**Revenue Ideas:**
| Idea | Effort | Revenue Potential | Risk |
|------|--------|-------------------|------|
| ...  | S/M/L  | $/$$/$$$          | L/M/H|

### 3.3 Traffic & Exposure — How to Get Users

Research acquisition channels:
```
Search: "[product category] marketing strategies"

Search: "[competitor] marketing strategy"
Search: "developer marketing tactics"
```

**Organic Channels:**
- SEO opportunities (what keywords to target?)

- Open source strategy (what to open source?)
- Word of mouth triggers (what makes users share?)

**Paid Channels:**

**Viral Mechanics:**
- Built-in sharing moments?
- Referral program design?
- Network effects potential?

**PR & Awareness:**

## Mindset
