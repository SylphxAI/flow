# Discovery Guideline

## Tech Stack

* Research across the product's full stack as needed

## Non-Negotiables

* None — this is pure exploration

## Context

Discovery is about finding what's missing, what's possible, and what would make the product significantly more competitive. It's not about fixing bugs — it's about identifying opportunities that don't yet exist.

Look at competitors, market trends, user expectations, and technological possibilities. What would make users choose this product over alternatives? What capabilities would unlock new business models?

## Driving Questions

* What are competitors doing that we're not?
* What do users expect based on industry standards that we lack?
* What integrations would add significant value?
* What pricing models are common in the market and how do we compare?
* What technical capabilities could enable new business models?
* What would make this product a category leader rather than a follower?
