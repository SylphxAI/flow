Stop. Step back. Challenge everything you just did.

## Questions to Answer

### 1. State of the Art?

- Is this how top engineers at FAANG would solve it?
- Are you using modern APIs, patterns, and approaches?

### 2. Correct Approach or Workaround?
- Does this solve the ROOT CAUSE or just the symptom?
- Is this a proper fix or a hack that will break later?
- Would you be embarrassed if a senior engineer reviewed this?
- Is there technical debt being created?

### 3. Clean & Complete?
- Zero dead code?
- Zero unused imports?
- Zero TODOs left behind?
- Zero console.logs or debug code?
- All edge cases handled?
- Error handling complete?

### 4. Human Experience?
- Is the UX intuitive? Would a user understand without explanation?
- Are error messages helpful and actionable?
- Is the UI responsive and accessible?
- Does it feel polished, not janky?

### 5. Better Way?
- What would you do differently with unlimited time?
- Is there a simpler solution you overlooked?
- Could this be more elegant?
- What would 10x improvement look like?

2. **Audit** each change against the questions above
3. **Identify** anything that's not truly excellent
4. **Fix** or **flag** issues found
5. **Report** your findings honestly

## Standards

* "Good enough" is NOT acceptable
* If you wouldn't stake your reputation on it, fix it
* Perfection is the goal, not completion
* Clean code > working code > fast code

## Output

After review, report:
- ✅ What meets the bar
- ⚠️ What could be better (and how)
- ❌ What needs immediate fixing
- 🎯 Actions taken or recommended
