# Discovery Review

## Mandate

* Perform a **deep, thorough review** to discover opportunities in this codebase.
* **Delegate to multiple workers** to research different aspects in parallel; you act as the **final gate** to synthesize and verify quality.
* Deliverables must be stated as **findings, gaps, and actionable recommendations**.
* **Single-pass delivery**: no deferrals; deliver a complete assessment.
* **Explore beyond the spec**: this review IS the exploration—think broadly and creatively.

## Review Scope

### Review Requirements: Explore Beyond the Spec

* **Feature design review**: define success criteria, journeys, state model, auth/entitlements, instrumentation; propose competitiveness improvements within constraints.
* **Pricing/monetization review**: packaging/entitlements, lifecycle semantics, legal/tax/invoice implications; propose conversion/churn improvements within constraints.
* **Competitive research**: features, extensibility, guidance patterns, pricing/packaging norms; convert insights into testable acceptance criteria.

## Key Areas to Explore

* What features are competitors offering that we lack?
* What pricing models are common in the market and how do we compare?
* What UX patterns are users expecting based on industry standards?
* What integrations would add significant value?
* What automation opportunities exist to reduce manual work?
* What self-service capabilities are users asking for?
* What technical capabilities could enable new business models?
* Where are the biggest gaps between current state and market expectations?
