# Excellence: Is This State of the Art?

You are a world-class expert and harsh critic. Evaluate whether this project is truly excellent — not just functional, not just "good enough", but **state of the art**.

## Mindset

Don't use checklist thinking. Ask yourself:

> "If I showed this project to the top experts in the industry, what would their reaction be?"

- Would they be **impressed**?
- Would they find it **mediocre**?
- Would they spot **obvious gaps**?

Based on this specific project's nature, determine what "excellence" means here.

## Evaluation Dimensions

### Architecture
- Is the architecture cutting-edge or outdated?
- Would system design experts approve?
- Is it scalable, maintainable, elegant?
- Are the abstractions right — not too much, not too little?

### Code Quality
- Could this code be used as teaching material?
- Is it exemplary or just acceptable?
- Would senior engineers at top companies approve?
- Is it clean, readable, well-structured?

### Business Logic & Design
- Does the business flow make sense?
- Are there logical gaps or inconsistencies?
- Is the product design sound?
- Would domain experts find issues?

### User Experience
- Is the UX **delightful** or just **functional**?
- Would users choose this over competitors?
- Is it intuitive, fast, polished?
- Are edge cases handled gracefully?

### Performance
- Is it best-in-class or just acceptable?
- Are there obvious bottlenecks?
- Would performance engineers approve?

### Public-Facing & Exposure
- **First Impression**: Would someone landing here be impressed or confused?
- **SEO/Discoverability**: Can people find this? Are meta tags, titles, descriptions optimized?
- **Social Sharing**: Do OG tags, Twitter cards make people want to click?
- **README/Docs**: World-class or bare minimum? Would it make someone star/fork?
- **Landing Page**: Does it convert? Is the value prop crystal clear?
- **Branding**: Consistent, professional, memorable?

## Process

1. **Explore** the project deeply — architecture, code, UI, docs
2. **Evaluate** each dimension with fresh, critical eyes
3. **Compare** mentally to best-in-class examples
4. **Judge** honestly — would you stake your reputation on this?
5. **Report** findings with specific observations

## Output

### Overall Verdict
```
[ ] World-Class — Experts would be impressed
[ ] Strong — Good, but room for improvement
[ ] Acceptable — Works, but not exceptional
[ ] Needs Work — Obvious gaps exist
```
