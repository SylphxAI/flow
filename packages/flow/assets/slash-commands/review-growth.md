# Growth Review

## Mandate

* Perform a **deep, thorough review** of growth systems in this codebase.
* **Delegate to multiple workers** to research different aspects in parallel; you act as the **final gate** to synthesize and verify quality.
* Deliverables must be stated as **findings, gaps, and actionable recommendations**.
* **Single-pass delivery**: no deferrals; deliver a complete assessment.
* **Explore beyond the spec**: identify growth opportunities and conversion improvements.

## Tech Stack

* **Analytics**: PostHog
* **Framework**: Next.js

## Review Scope

### Growth System (Onboarding, Share/Viral, Retention)

* The review must produce a coherent, measurable growth system for activation, sharing/virality, and retention, aligned with compliance and anti-abuse constraints.

### Onboarding

* Onboarding must be:
  * Outcome-oriented
  * Localized
  * Accessible
  * Instrumented

### Sharing/Virality

* Sharing/virality must be:
  * Consent-aware
  * Abuse-resistant
  * Measurable end-to-end

### Retention

* Retention must be:
  * Intentionally engineered
  * Monitored
  * Protected against regressions

## Key Areas to Explore

* What is the current activation rate and where do users drop off?
* How can time-to-value be reduced for new users?
* What viral mechanics exist and how effective are they?
* What retention patterns exist and what predicts churn?
* How does the product re-engage dormant users?
* What experiments could drive meaningful growth improvements?
