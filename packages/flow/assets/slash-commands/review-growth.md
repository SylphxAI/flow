# Growth Review

## Mandate

* Perform a **deep, thorough review** of growth systems in this codebase.
* **Delegate to multiple workers** to research different aspects in parallel; you act as the **final gate** to synthesize and verify quality.
* Deliverables must be stated as **findings, gaps, and actionable recommendations**.
* **Single-pass delivery**: no deferrals; deliver a complete assessment.
* **Explore beyond the spec**: identify growth opportunities that don't yet exist.

## Tech Stack

* **Analytics**: PostHog
* **Framework**: Next.js

## Non-Negotiables

* Sharing/virality mechanics must be consent-aware
* Growth instrumentation must not violate privacy constraints

## Context

Growth isn't about tricks — it's about removing friction from value delivery. Users who quickly experience value stay; users who don't, leave.

The review should consider: what's preventing users from reaching their "aha moment" faster? What would make them want to share? What brings them back? These aren't features to add — they're fundamental product questions.

## Driving Questions

* Where do users drop off before experiencing value?
* What would cut time-to-value in half?
* Why would a user tell someone else about this product?
* What brings users back after their first session?
* What signals predict churn before it happens?
* What would a 10x better onboarding look like?
