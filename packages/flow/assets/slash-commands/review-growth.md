# Growth Review

## Mandate

* Perform a **deep, thorough review** of growth systems in this codebase.
* **Delegate to multiple workers** to research different aspects in parallel; you act as the **final gate** to synthesize and verify quality.
* Deliverables must be stated as **findings, gaps, and actionable recommendations**.
* **Single-pass delivery**: no deferrals; deliver a complete assessment.

## Review Scope

### Growth System (Onboarding, Share/Viral, Retention)

* The review must produce a coherent, measurable growth system for activation, sharing/virality, and retention, aligned with compliance and anti-abuse constraints.

### Onboarding

* Onboarding must be:
  * Outcome-oriented
  * Localized
  * Accessible
  * Instrumented

### Sharing/Virality

* Sharing/virality must be:
  * Consent-aware
  * Abuse-resistant
  * Measurable end-to-end

### Retention

* Retention must be:
  * Intentionally engineered
  * Monitored
  * Protected against regressions

### Growth Best Practices

* Clear value proposition on landing
* Frictionless signup
* Time-to-value optimization
* Activation milestones defined
* Re-engagement campaigns
* Churn prediction/prevention
* NPS/satisfaction tracking
