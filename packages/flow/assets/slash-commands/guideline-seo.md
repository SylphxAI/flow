# SEO Guideline

## Tech Stack

* **Framework**: Next.js (SSR-first for indexable/discovery)

## Non-Negotiables

* All pages must have metadata (title, description)
* Canonical URLs must be correct (no duplicate content)
* sitemap.xml and robots.txt must exist and be correct

## Context

SEO is about being found when people are looking for what you offer. Good SEO isn't tricks — it's making content genuinely useful and technically accessible to search engines.

Consider: what queries should this product rank for? What content would genuinely serve those searchers? Is the technical foundation (metadata, structure, performance) supporting or hindering discoverability?

## Driving Questions

* What queries should this product rank #1 for?
* What content gaps exist that competitors are filling?
* Where are we losing rankings due to technical issues?
* What structured data opportunities are we missing?
* How does Core Web Vitals performance affect our search rankings?
* What would make Google consider this site authoritative in our domain?
