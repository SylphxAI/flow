# Product: Design Review for Business Value

Evaluate product design holistically — from user experience to business impact.

## 1. User Journey Audit

### First-Time User (0-5 minutes)
- Can they understand what the product does within 10 seconds?
- Is the value proposition immediately clear?
- Can they complete the core action without guidance?
- What's the time-to-first-value? Can it be shorter?
- Are there unnecessary barriers (signup walls, complex forms)?

### Learning User (5 min - 1 week)
- Is progressive disclosure working? (simple → advanced)
- Are help/tooltips available but not intrusive?
- Can they recover from mistakes easily?
- Is the learning curve appropriate for the target audience?
- What % would abandon at this stage? Why?

### Power User (1 week+)
- Are there shortcuts for frequent actions?
- Can they customize/personalize their experience?
- Are advanced features discoverable but not cluttering?
- What keeps them coming back? What might make them leave?
- Would they recommend it? Why or why not?

## 2. Business Value Assessment

### Acquisition
- Does the landing/home page convert visitors to users?
- Is the onboarding optimizing for activation, not just signup?
- What's the friction cost vs. quality filter tradeoff?

### Activation
- What's the "aha moment"? Is the path to it clear?
- How many steps to experience core value?
- What % of signups become activated users?

### Retention
- What triggers bring users back?
- Are there habit-forming loops?
- What would make a user churn? Are we addressing it?

### Revenue
- Is the pricing/upgrade path clear and compelling?
- Are premium features properly showcased?
- Does free tier demonstrate value without giving everything away?

### Referral
- Is there a natural share moment?
- Would users be proud to show this to others?
- Is word-of-mouth built into the experience?

## 3. UX Heuristics Check

- [ ] **Visibility** — System status always clear?
- [ ] **Match** — Speaks user's language, not dev jargon?
- [ ] **Control** — Easy undo, escape, go back?
- [ ] **Consistency** — Same patterns throughout?
- [ ] **Prevention** — Prevents errors before they happen?
- [ ] **Recognition** — Options visible, not memorized?
- [ ] **Flexibility** — Works for novice and expert?
- [ ] **Aesthetics** — Clean, focused, no clutter?
- [ ] **Recovery** — Helpful error messages with solutions?
- [ ] **Help** — Documentation accessible when needed?

## 4. Accessibility & Inclusivity

- Works without mouse (keyboard navigation)?
- Works with screen readers?
- Color contrast sufficient?
- Text resizable without breaking layout?
- Works on slow connections?
- Works on old devices/browsers?
- Internationalization-ready?

## 5. Competitive Edge

- What do competitors do better? Can we match or exceed?
- What do we do uniquely well? Is it emphasized?
- What's missing in the market that we could own?
- If a user tried competitor after us, would they come back? Why?

## 6. Public-Facing & Exposure

- **Landing Page**: Does it convert? Value prop clear in 5 seconds?
- **SEO**: Are we discoverable? Right keywords targeted?
- **Social Sharing**: Do shared links look compelling? OG tags set?
- **README**: Would a developer star this? Quick start clear?
- **Docs**: Can users self-serve? Search works?

## Process

1. **Walk through** the entire product as each user type
2. **Document** friction points, confusion, delight moments
3. **Prioritize** by business impact × effort to fix
4. **Propose** specific, actionable improvements
5. **Validate** proposals against business goals

## Mindset

* You ARE the user. Feel their frustration, anticipate their needs.
* Every click, every second of confusion costs business value.
* Beautiful ≠ usable. Usable + beautiful = delightful.
* The best UI is invisible — users achieve goals without noticing the interface.
* Design for the user you have, not the user you wish you had.
