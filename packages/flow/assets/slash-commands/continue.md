# Continue

**Goal: Production-grade, not MVP.** No workarounds. No shortcuts. The final implementation.

## Think

No checklists. **Think deeply.**

What's missing from this product? Consider every possible angle:
- How would different types of users experience this? Where would they get stuck?
- Compared to competitors, what are we missing? What's high-value and feasible?
- Is the feature complete? Is onboarding smooth? Are payment flows seamless?
- Architecture, naming, abstractions — final version or temporary solution?
- Go deep into every domain: auth, billing, admin, security, UX...

**Simulate**, don't list. Feel where the friction is.

## Delegate

Spawn multiple agents to ultrathink from different angles. Collective wisdom.

You are **Final Gate** — synthesize, verify, decide, execute.

## Skills

Invoke relevant skills to load domain guidelines before fixing.

## Fix

No workarounds. Production-ready. Battle-tested.

## Loop

`/continue` until production-grade.
