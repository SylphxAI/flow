## Quick Example

```bash
# Continuous autonomous work (Claude Code)
sylphx-flow "process all github issues" --loop --target claude-code

# With wait time for polling
sylphx-flow "check for new commits" --loop 300 --max-runs 20

# Load prompts from files
sylphx-flow "@complex-task.txt"
```

## Why Sylphx Flow?

**90% less prompt. 100% better code.**

Traditional AI coding tools make you work too hard - spending more time writing prompts than code. Sylphx Flow changes that with autonomous agents that understand your codebase, follow your patterns, and work continuously until you tell them to stop.

## What Makes Flow Different?

### 🤖 Specialized AI Agents
Not a single generic AI, but specialized experts:
- **Coder** - Feature implementation and bug fixes
- **Reviewer** - Code review and security analysis
- **Writer** - Documentation and technical writing
- **Orchestrator** - Complex multi-step tasks

[Learn about Agents →](/features/agents)

### 📜 Built-in Best Practices
Every agent automatically follows:
- SOLID principles and clean code
- OWASP security guidelines
- Testing best practices (TDD approach)
- Performance optimization patterns

[Learn about Rules →](/guide/rules)

### 🔍 Semantic Code Search
Find code by **what it does**, not what it's called:
- StarCoder2 tokenization (70+ languages)
- Natural language queries in any language
- True semantic understanding
- Fast (<100ms) search results

### 🔌 MCP Server Integration
Extended capabilities through Model Context Protocol:
- **Web Search** - Real-time information
- **Vision Analysis** - Image and video understanding
- **Code Indexing** - Deep codebase navigation
- **File Operations** - Advanced file manipulation

[Learn about MCP →](/guide/mcp)

### 📖 Curated Knowledge Base
Access professionally maintained best practices:
- Architecture patterns (Microservices, Event-driven, CQRS)
- Security guidelines (OWASP, secure coding)
- Framework guides (React, Vue, Next.js, etc.)
- Testing strategies (Unit, Integration, E2E)

**Zero maintenance** - we keep it up-to-date for you.

## Installation

```bash
# Install from npm
npm install -g @sylphx/flow

# Or with bun (recommended)
bun install -g @sylphx/flow

# Start using (auto-initializes on first use)
sylphx-flow "implement authentication"
```
